# 2D Finite Element Stress Analysis 🌐

This software conducts stress analysis in a 2D plane using the plane strain approximation method. It offers a comprehensive set of tools to investigate stress distribution in materials, invaluable in engineering and materials science.

## Features ✨

- **Isoparametric Shape Functions**: Utilizes shape and gradient defining functions for stress analysis.
- **Mesh Formation**: Enables easy creation of a mesh with defined parameters for the structure.
- **Material Model - Plane Strain**: Models materials under plane strain conditions using material properties.
- **Global Stiffness Matrix Calculation**: Computes stiffness matrix via numerical integration for each element.
- **Nodal Forces and Boundary Conditions**: Assigns crucial conditions for simulating real-world scenarios.
- **Solving Linear System**: Solves the linear system to obtain displacement values.
- **Displacement Visualization**: Offers contour plots for understanding stress distribution.

## Usage 🚀

To use the software:
1. Ensure necessary libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
